# Battle-Cats-File-Byte-Adder
Simple app that makes battle cats files encryptable

When I started modding battle cats, I used fieryhenry's [battle cats save editor](https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Save-File-Editor) and later, his [dedicated game modder](https://github.com/fieryhenry/Battle-Cats-Game-Modder) to edit the game files. But the problem is the editor only supports editing certain files, which is not really enough for me. So I tried manually editing files, and when I attempted to encrypt them...

It doesn't work!

So I looked into the code of the modder and found a method that edits the file size so they can encrypt properly. I wrote a simple app that lets you choose the files to be made encryptable and used that code mentioned earlier to do its thing. Now I can do much more with the game, heh.
